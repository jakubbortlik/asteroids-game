# asteroids-game
This is a fun project based on a boot.dev task.

# Installation
- if you have `Poetry` installed just run `poetry install` in the project's root directory
- alternatively you can run `pip install -e .` (in a dedicated virtual environment)

# Running the game
- activate the poetry shell (`poetry shell`) and just type `asteroids` in the command line
- or run `poetry run asteroids`
- alternatively, if the above does not work, run `python main.py` in the dedicated virtual
  environment
